## Project Description
A website to search for restaurants and view their reviews. User should register with the website and then login to visit a restaurant or post a review. User can view all the details of the restaurant such as address, contact details, reviews, rating etc.

### Features
This website will have a search feature which allows the user to search for a specific restaurant. After visiting a restaurant user can post a review and rate the restaurant’s food, hospitality, ambience etc.

This project uses Restaurant data from [OpenTable API http://opentable.herokuapp.com](http://opentable.herokuapp.com)

### NOTE:
This application uses a database application server provided by my professor which was a central server setup for class purposes.
You might have to change database address under *spring.datasource.url* in the file *application.properties* to work.(since the database was for class purposes it is no longer active)
